## Code Blocks

Zensical uses [Pygments] to highlight code blocks.

[Pygments]: https://pygments.org/

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="2" title="Code blocks"
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!") # (1)!

greet("Zensical")
```

1.  :man_raising_hand: I'm a code annotation! I can contain `code`, __formatted
    text__, images, ... basically anything that can be written in Markdown.

Code can also be highlighted inline: `#!python print("Hello from Python!")`.

## Maths

Mathematical formulae can be written using LaTeX syntax and rendered using
MathJax.

$$
\cos x=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k)!}x^{2k}
$$

!!! warning "Needs configuration"
    Note that MathJax is included via a `script` tag on this page and is not
    configured in the generated default configuration to avoid including it
    in a pages that do not need it. See the documentation for details on how
    to configure it on all your pages if they are more Maths-heavy than these
    simple starter pages.

[Read the documentation](https://zensical.org/docs/authoring/math)

<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://unpkg.com/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
<script>
  window.MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [["\\(", "\\)"]],
      displayMath: [["\\[", "\\]"]],
      processEscapes: true,
      processEnvironments: true
    },
    options: {
      ignoreHtmlClass: ".*|",
      processHtmlClass: "arithmatex"
